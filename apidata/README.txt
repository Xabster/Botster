Usage instructions for getting api data

For javadocs, simply download the index files for the javadoc of your choice. You can use the dlapi.sh script. For JDK7+ docs, run fixapi.sh afterwards (to remove some formatting, otherwise the parser won't work correctly)

For source code, the list may have to be manually compiled. The OpenJDK class list, for example, was generated by checking out the classes/ subdir of the OpenJDK, and then listed with

find . -name *.java
